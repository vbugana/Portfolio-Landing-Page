# Portfolio-Landing-Page

This is my first Responsive Landing page using HTML & CSS...It is an exercise to practive CSS with grid and flex functionality. 

## Description

* When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about myself, my work, and how to contact me
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications
* When presented with the my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

It should look like the template : ![Alt Text](https://github.com/vbugana/Portfolio-Landing-Page/blob/main/01-css-challenge-demo.gif)
